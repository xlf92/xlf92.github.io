It includes many well-known active contour models: 
* CV - "Chan, Active contours without edges"
* RSF - "Li, Minimization of region-scalable fitting energy for image segmentation"
* LIF - "Zhang, Active contours driven by local image fitting energy"
* LRCV - "Liu, A local region-based Chanâ€“Vese model for image segmentation"
* LGDF - "Wang,  Active contours driven by local Gaussian distribution fitting energy"
* LGIF - "Wang, Active contours driven by local and global intensity fitting energy with application to brain MR image segmentation"
* DRLSE - "LI, Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution and Its Application to Image Segmentation"
* GML - "Xiao, Active Contours driven by Grayscale Morphology Fitting Energy for Fast Image Segmentation"
* Proposed methods: 
  * Syntropic fitting - "Ding, Improved Region-Scalable fitting model with robust initialization for image segmentation "
  * Pre-fitting - "Ding, Active Contours driven by Local Pre-Fitting Energy for Fast Image Segmentation"

Note: the implementation efficiency of this GUI is much faster than the code written by Matlab.
