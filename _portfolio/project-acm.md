Image segmentation is an important and complex task in the field of image processing and computer vision. This paper studies the active contour model based on local region fitting energy. The traditional local fitting model can effectively segment images with intensity inhomogeneity, but their segmentation speed is slow and sensitive to the initial contour. To solve these problems, three improved models are proposed in this paper:

1. The model driven by local fitting energy with the same direction.

2. The model combined local region fitting energy and optimized LoG energy.

3. The model driven by local pre-fitting energy.
