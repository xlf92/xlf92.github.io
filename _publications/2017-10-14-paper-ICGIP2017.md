In this paper, a robust and fast active contour model is proposed for image segmentation in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity. By introducing the local image intensities fitting functions before the evolution of curve, the proposed model can effectively segment images with intensity inhomogeneity. And the computation cost is low because the fitting functions do not need to be updated in each iteration. Experiments have shown that the proposed model has a higher segmentation efficiency compared to some well-known active contour models based on local region fitting energy. In addition, the proposed model is robust to initialization, which allows the initial level set function to be a small constant function.
