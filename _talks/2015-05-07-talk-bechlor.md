**Analysis of stochastic resonance effect under the different potential functions**    

This paper mainly studied the stochastic resonance effect under different potential functions and the detection method of weak signal, mainly including classical bistable system, linear stochastic resonance model and symmetric parabolic model, quantitatively analyze its effects under different potential function, namely compare the effect of detecting weak periodic signal under the background of the strong noise.  

Firstly, this paper introduces the background and significance of the stochastic resonance , describes the domestic and foreign current situation of this subject, analyze the stochastic resonance theory briefly, and introduces the classical bistable system stochastic resonance mechanism and several common measurement methods of stochastic resonance.  

Secondly, we analyze and verify the drawbacks of output saturation in classical bistable system. Through the analysis of the classical bistable potential function of saturation characteristics, founds that biquadratic function relationship between potential energy and displacement is the fundamental reason for saturation. So the piecewise linear system and symmetric parabolic system is given on the basis of its saturation drawbacks, and derive this two systemsâ€™ output SNR expressions theoretically.  

Then we do the numerical simulation of classical bistable system, piecewise linear stochastic resonance model and symmetric parabolic stochastic resonance model, and studies the output of the system under the action of periodic signal alone, or under the action of noise alone, or under the interaction of periodic signal and noise. The result shows that the stochastic resonance effect in symmetric parabolic system is the most strong, piecewise linear systems is the second and the classical bistable system is the worst.
Then we studies the output system under the different intensity noise, including power spectral and signal-to-noise ratio change. The result shows that both the signal-to-noise ratio and the power spectrum of the system output will increase first and then decrease with the intensity of noise increasing.  

Finally, we used stochastic resonance method to detect the bearing fault signal. The results show that the detection of weak signal can be more realized by the method of the random resonance based on the symmetric parabolic bitable system.
